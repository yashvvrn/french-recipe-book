                    <p>Choux pastry (pâte à choux) is a light, airy French pastry dough used to make an impressive array of desserts including éclairs, profiteroles, and cream puffs. The unique twice-cooked method creates steam that causes the pastry to puff dramatically in the oven, forming a hollow center perfect for filling with cream, custard, or other delicious fillings.</p>

                        <h2>Preparation</h2>
                        <p>Choux pastry requires precision in technique but uses simple ingredients. The dough is first cooked on the stovetop, then eggs are incorporated to create a glossy, pipeable mixture. When baked, the high moisture content creates steam that puffs the pastry, resulting in a crisp exterior and hollow interior.</p>

                                <li>Ensure all ingredients are measured precisely for the best results.</li>
                                <li>The dough should be the right consistency - thick enough to hold its shape when piped but not too stiff.</li>
                                <li>Don't open the oven door during the first 25 minutes of baking to prevent the pastry from collapsing.</li>
                                <li>Pierce each pastry with a small hole after baking to allow steam to escape and prevent sogginess.</li>

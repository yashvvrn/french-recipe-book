                        <p>Pain au Chocolat, also known as Chocolate Croissant, is a delectable French pastry consisting of a rectangle of buttery, flaky croissant dough wrapped around one or two pieces of dark chocolate. This beloved breakfast treat is a staple in French bakeries and cafés, offering the perfect balance of crisp, buttery layers and rich, melting chocolate.</p>

                            <p>Making Pain au Chocolat is a labor of love that requires patience and precision. The process involves creating a laminated dough by folding butter into the dough multiple times to create dozens of alternating layers of butter and dough. When baked, these layers create the signature flaky, honeycomb-like texture that makes this pastry so special.</p>

                                    <li>Keep all ingredients cold throughout the process to prevent the butter from melting into the dough.</li>
                                    <li>Allow sufficient resting time between folds to relax the gluten and make rolling easier.</li>
                                    <li>Use high-quality chocolate that will melt beautifully but still hold its shape.</li>
                                    <li>For the best rise, proof the pastries until they're visibly puffy before baking.</li>
